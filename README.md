## 💡 Business Problem

Organizations and institutions face significant challenges in monitoring and securing valuable assets:

- **Museums & Galleries**: Protecting priceless artifacts and artwork from theft or unauthorized access
- **Healthcare Facilities**: Tracking critical medical equipment and pharmaceutical inventory
- **Retail & Warehouses**: Preventing inventory shrinkage and unauthorized item removal
- **Corporate Offices**: Monitoring sensitive equipment (servers, laptops, proprietary hardware)
- **Residential Security**: Safeguarding high-value personal items (jewelry, collectibles, electronics)

Traditional surveillance systems are reactive and require constant human monitoring. This solution provides **proactive, intelligent threat detection** powered by machine learning.
